# Back-Propagation-Algorithm
This project uses a Neural Network (NN) to predict the 'Age' column from an Excel dataset. The model utilizes the ReLU activation function and is trained using the backpropagation algorithm. Training is conducted for 1000 epochs with a learning rate of 0.0001. Results are evaluated with visualizations.
